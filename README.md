## üå± Database Seeder

The project includes a comprehensive database seeder that can generate realistic test data for development and testing purposes.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run with small test dataset (100 users, 50 questions, etc.)
npm run seed:test

# Run with full production dataset (500k users, 50k questions, etc.)
npm run seed:production

# Run with custom configuration
npm run seed:custom
```

### Seeder Features

- **Realistic Data**: Generates meaningful questions, answers, and user profiles
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently handles large datasets with configurable batch sizes
- **Relationship Management**: Properly seeds many-to-many relationships
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicators during seeding
- **Multiple Configurations**: Test, production, and custom modes

### Data Volumes

**Test Mode:**
- Users: 100
- Questions: 50
- Answers: 150
- Tags: 20
- Votes: 2-5 per answer

**Production Mode:**
- Users: 500,000
- Questions: 50,000
- Answers: 150,000
